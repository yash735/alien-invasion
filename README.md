# Alien Invasion: Shoot em down!!
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. Use the arrow keys to move the ship right and left, and press the spacebar to shoot bullets. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. Your goal is to shoot and destroy all the aliens. After clearing a fleet, a new, faster fleet appears. If an alien hits your ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, you lose a ship. The game ends when you lose three ships. Enjoy battling increasingly challenging alien fleets!
