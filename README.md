# Alien Invasion: Shoot em down!!
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a spaceship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. Use the arrow keys to move the ship right and left, and press the spacebar to shoot bullets. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. Your goal is to shoot and destroy all the aliens. After clearing a fleet, a new, faster fleet appears. If an alien hits your ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, you lose a ship. The game ends when you lose three ships. Enjoy battling increasingly challenging alien fleets!


### Iteration - 1
The game runs properly, allowing the player to move the spaceship and shoot bullets using the arrow keys.

### Iteration - 2
An Alien UFO has now been added to the game. At this stage, a swarm of alien UFOs moves towards the spaceship in a left-right-down pattern. The player can shoot down these aliens.

If an alien UFO touches the spaceship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the game resets with a new swarm of alien UFOs, and the spaceship returns to its starting position. If the player successfully shoots down all the UFOs, a new swarm appears. However, if a UFO touches the spaceship or the ground three times, the game will freeze.
